                <p>I was inspired to make this artwork after reading an article that shocked me: how Earth’s support systems will collapse in 2050 if we don’t drastically change the rate at which we consume resources. It made me think about how disconnected we are from the consequences of our everyday mindless purchases. Every barcode we scan costs more than just our money, it fells forests and destroys habitats. The number under the barcode in my art (46,171,400) is the area of green land left on Earth in square kilometres, and it’s getting smaller every day. My art is also interactive; the barcode can also be scanned using a barcode scanning mobile app, and it’ll open a URL to a website I made. The website has live data about forests, and information about how common items fuel deforestation. It can be accessed through this link: https://jezzylol.github.io/Money-Grows-on-Trees/ 
                    My goal isn’t just to express the message that consumerism contributes to deforestation, but to invite viewers to engage with it and maybe even question what we take for granted.</p>
